// You want to write a number out of plastic, and you have plastic sets of digits '0' to '9'.
// Each set has 10 digits, each digit exactly once. Given a number, you need to count the
// number of sets that have to be used to create the number.

// e.g.
// Number 10, can be written with '1' and '0' both of which are from one set.
// Number 100, in order to write the two zeros, you need to use two sets.
// At one point, you noticed that numbers 6 and 9 are the same, so you can easily reuse 6 as
// 9 and vice versa.
// e.g.
// Number 166, can be written by using one set, with numbers '1', '6' and then '9' rotated by
// 180 degrees.
// Input parameters:
// number - a number to be written with the plastic digits.
// Constraints:
// number will be between 0 and 1000000000 (one billion).
// Return:
// The count of plastic sets needed to write the number.
// Class Name:
// PlasticNumbers
// Method signature:
// public int countSets(int number)
